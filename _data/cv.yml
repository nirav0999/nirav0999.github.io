      description:
        - Given some positively and negatively labelled first order structures, we aim to find first order
          logical formulas that fit the given data completely (i.e. satisfies all positive structures and does not
          satisfy any negative structure).
        - To this end, I am presently working on optimized inductive synthesis of such formulas using techniques at the intersection of Program Synthesis
          and Constraint Solving (like Symbolic Execution and the <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3 SMT Solver</a>).

      description:
        - Developed a tool named VReadA (Visual Readability Analyzer), which generates a heatmap to give visual feedback on a text’s readability to the author. It analyzes the text for linguistic complexity,
          predictability, perplexity and coherence among sections.
        - Developed novel methods to measure coherence using similarity of sentence vectors in groups of consecutive sentences and used
          state-of-the-art Language Models, Word Vectors and NLP tools to get accurate results.
