    - title: 'Logic-guided learning methods'
      institution: <a href="https://ggndpsngh.github.io/">Prof. Gagandeep Singh</a>, Assistant Professor, Dept. of CSE, UIUC
      year: MAR 2023 - PRESENT
      description:
        - Working on training Deep Neural Networks to adhere to logical (symbolic) constraints.
        - Exploring ways to incorporate non-differentiable values like symbolic constraints or SMT solver outputs as training loss so that
          the network can learn representations consistent with the constraints.
        - Such networks can then be used to speed up tasks needing adherence to logical constraints (like Program Analysis).

    - title: 'Inductive Synthesis of Logical Classifiers'
      institution: <a href="https://madhu.cs.illinois.edu/">Prof. Madhusudan Parthasarathy</a>, Professor, Dept. of CSE, UIUC
      year: OCT 2022 - MAR 2023
      description:
        - Given some positively and negatively labelled first order structures, we aim to find first order
          logical formulas that fit the given data completely (i.e. satisfies all positive structures and does not
          satisfy any negative structure).
        - To this end, I worked on optimized inductive synthesis of such formulas using techniques at the intersection of Program Synthesis
          and Constraint Solving (like Symbolic Execution and the <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3 SMT Solver</a>).

      year: AUG 2019 - MAY 2020
      description:
        - Developed a tool named VReadA (Visual Readability Analyzer), which generates a heatmap to give visual feedback on a text’s readability to the author. It analyzes the text for linguistic complexity,
          predictability, perplexity and coherence among sections.
        - Developed novel methods to measure coherence using similarity of sentence vectors in groups of consecutive sentences and used
          state-of-the-art Language Models, Word Vectors and NLP tools to get accurate results.

      description:
        - Zelkova reasons about AWS access control policies by encoding them and verification conditions as SMT queries.
        - 'Some semantics can be hard to encode in SMT, like conditions that rely on type-casting. For e.g.: allow access if a string S in the request context is numerically less than 42.'
        - Developed efficient <span class="highlight">encodings using <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13477.pdf">SMTO</a> (SMT with Oracles)</span> to encode such <span class="highlight">type-casting semantics</span>.
          This <span class="highlight">solved ~30k production queries</span> relying on type-casting (unsolved before) with an average query solving time <span class="highlight">1 min</span>.
        - Also <span class="highlight">contributed to <a href="https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5">CVC5</a>'s SMTO solver</span> by identifying/fixing bugs and improving the oracles I/O interface.
        - Filled a patent and am currently working on a paper.
