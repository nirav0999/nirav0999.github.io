I am a PhD student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/).  
My research interests are at the intersection of Security and Machine Learning, particularly in practical adversarial attacks on large language models (LLMs). My work in these areas has been published in ACL, USENIX Security Symposium, ICWSM, and ICDE Workshop.

I recently completed my research-track MS at [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) with [Prof. Gang Wang](https://gangw.cs.illinois.edu/) in the area of Adversarial Machine Learning with a focus on Foundation Models. Previously, I have worked on watermarking fine-tuned LLM-generated text (ACL Findings'21) with [Prof. Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/) (UC Davis) and [Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://tanmoychak.com/) (IIT Delhi).

Before my MS, I graduated with a B. Tech. degree in Computer Science from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iitg.ac.in/) in June 2021, where I worked in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Graphs, and Security & Privacy (S&P). I was a member of [LCS2](https://lcs2.in/) and the [Complex Systems Lab](https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/). I worked on identifying anomalies in the YouTube Blackmarket Network using graphs (ICWSM'22). I also led the information retrieval team for [RecipeDB](https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb/) - a worldwide repository of recipes (ICDE Workshop, Oxford University Press).

I was a Research Intern at LG AI Research last summer (2024). I worked on alignment algorithms for LLMs with [Tolga Ergen](https://tolgaergen.github.io/) and [Honglak Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/). Prior to this, I was an Applied Science intern at [Ema Unlimited](https://ema.co/) last summer (2023). I worked with the Generative AI Team on converting natural language to SQL Commands. I have also worked as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engineer at [Prodigal Technologies](https://www.prodigaltech.com/) for a year, where I focused on problems of Dialogue State Tracking (DST), Information Retrieval (IR), and optimizing search queries with a specific focus on finance-related conversations. Additionally, I have interned at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) and [Centre de Sciences Humanities (CSH Delhi)](https://www.csh-delhi.com/).
