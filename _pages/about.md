I am a 2nd year research-track Master in Computer Science (MS CS) student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I am interested in the real-world applications of Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Security & Privacy. My work in these areas has been published/under review in ACL, USENIX Security Symposium, ICWSM.

I am presently working with [Prof. Gang Wang](https://gangw.cs.illinois.edu/) on Adversarial Machine Learning with a focus on Foundation Models. Previously, I have worked on watermarking fine-tuned LLM-generated text  (ACL Findings'21) with [Prof. Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/) (UC Davis) and [Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://tanmoychak.com/) (IIT Delhi). I am a Graduate Teaching Assistant for CS124: Introduction to Computer Science course this semester (Fall 2023).

Before my MS, I graduated with a B. Tech. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/">IIIT Delhi</a> in June 2021, where I worked in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Graphs and Security & Privacy (S&P). I was an member of [LCS2](https://lcs2.in/) and the [Complex Systems Lab](https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/). I worked on identifying anomalies in the YouTube Blackmarket Network using Graphs (ICSWM'22). I also led the information retrieval team for [RecipeDB](https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb/) - a worldwide repository of recipes (ICDE Workshop, Oxford University Press).

I was an Applied Science intern at [Ema Inc.](https://ema.co/) this summer (2023). I worked with the Generative AI Team on converting Natural language to SQL Commands. I have also worked as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engineer at [Prodigal Technologies](https://www.prodigaltech.com/) for a year, where I worked on problems of Information Retrieval (IR), Event Tagging, and Optimizing Search Queries. Additionally, I have interned at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) and [Centre de Sciences Humanities (CSH Delhi)](https://www.csh-delhi.com/).
