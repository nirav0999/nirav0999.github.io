I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) in the [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/). I am working with [Prof. Gang Wang](https://gangw.cs.illinois.edu/) at the intersection of Security and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in practical adversarial attacks on large language models (LLMs). My work in these areas has been published in **the** ACL, USENIX Security Symposium, ICWSM, and **the** ICDE Workshop.

I recently completed my research-track M.S. at **the** [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) with [Prof. Gang Wang](https://gangw.cs.illinois.edu/) in the area of Adversarial Machine Learning with a focus on Foundation Models. Previously, I **worked** on watermarking fine-tuned LLM-generated text (ACL Findings '21) with [Prof. Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/) (UC Davis) and [Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://tanmoychak.com/) (IIT Delhi).

Before my PhD, I graduated with my MS in CS from UIUC in 2024. Prior to that, I did my B.Tech. degree in Computer Science from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iitg.ac.in/) in June 2021, where I worked in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Graphs, and Security & Privacy (S&P). I was a member of [LCS2](https://lcs2.in/) and the [Complex Systems Lab](https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/). I worked on identifying anomalies in the YouTube Blackmarket Network using graphs (ICWSM '22). I also led the information retrieval team for [RecipeDB](https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb/) - a worldwide repository of recipes (ICDE Workshop, Oxford University Press).

I was a Research Intern at LG AI Research last summer (2024). I worked on alignment algorithms for LLMs with [Tolga Ergen](https://tolgaergen.github.io/) and [Honglak Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/). Prior to this, I was an Applied Science intern at [Ema Unlimited](https://ema.co/) last summer (2023). I worked with the Generative AI Team on converting natural language to SQL Commands. I have also worked as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engineer at [Prodigal Technologies](https://www.prodigaltech.com/) for a year, where I focused on problems of Dialogue State Tracking (DST), Information Retrieval (IR), and optimizing search queries with a specific focus on finance-related conversations. Additionally, I **interned** at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) and [Centre de Sciences Humaines (CSH Delhi)](https://www.csh-delhi.com/).
